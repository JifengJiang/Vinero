Which one is the most important thing to video production? There are some tips on saving budget when making decisions on video production." data-media="img/blog/blog-1-2.png"></div>
							<br>
							<p>Have you heard about this dilemma? No matter for what projects, there does not exist one which is fast, cheap, and great.<br>

								It happens to video production too. You have to make decisions on your videos.<br>
							</p>
							<img src="img/blog/blog-1-1.png" alt="" />
							<br>
							<br>
							<h4>Time – Quality – Cost</h4>
							<p>
								Consider these questions before you make any decisions:

							-	When do you want the finished video?<br>
							-	What quality level do you want for this video? You can search online for some sample videos of your expected quality.<br>
							-	How much budget you are going to allocate to this project?<br>
							-	Time, quality, cost, which one is the most important to you?<br>
							</p>
							<img src="img/blog/blog-1-2.png" alt="" />
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>Let’s say we have same budget for two similar projects. If we spend 2 month on it, the quality will be definitely much better than we rush it through within 3 weeks. If quality is the most important measurement for you, the faster time takes more budgets. If we are limited to time, we had to put more efforts to shorten the time, which costs higher-skilled worker and extra labor.<br>

								But in video production process, what influences these three factors? And how to decide which one should be sacrifice? The following phrases will help you through.<br>
							</p>
							<h4>What influences the TIME to produce a video?</h4>
							<p>In terms of video production process, we have three phases: pre-production, shooting, and post-production.<br>

								In pre-production phase, it takes time to figure out what message should be included in the video. Think about what the target audience of this video is, and what the core messages are. With more clear information, we can save a lot of time discovering what to say in the video. <a href="single-blog2.html">In this article, there are some tips about how to define the core messages: What you should know before making a corporate video.</a><br>
							</p>
							<img src="img/blog/blog-1-3.png" alt="" />
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>Before shooting, we will have a shooting list based on the core message. The shooting list reflects how much time it takes to collect all the footage we need. Numbers of locations is the most influencing factor to shooting time as transportation and setting up takes lots of time. Another way to reduce shooting time is to add additional crew; however this will cost more budgets.<br>

								The post-production phase usually takes the longest time, and it affects the quality of the video directly. It takes time to correct color of each clip, and make supplicated animations and visual effects. The more hours we spend on post-editing, the more compelling the video can be.<br>
							</p>
							<h4>What influences the QUALITY to produce a video?</h4>
							<p>Everyone wants a good quality video. How can we improve the quality is an essential question.<br>
								The quality of the video are reflected in two aspects: storytelling and picture quality.<br>

								To tell the story compellingly and correctly, we need efforts in pre-production stage where we decide the core message and shooting list. Such as writers, good writers produce touching stories. It is always recommended to spend more time to work out a good story that attracts the right audience in the very beginning.<br>

								Good picture quality relies on good footage and good post-editors. Experienced photographers and advanced equipment make sure the quality of the footage. With good footages, post-editors are easier to produce better drafts. In G’est Media, all photographers and editors are professional and experienced ones, what impacts video quality is the time. Slow fire makes sweet malt. More hours spend on post-editing, more elaborated the video can be.</p>
							<h4>What influences the COST to produce a video?</h4>
							<p>Budget is the fundamental aspect that influences all others in video production. Most companies are always asking clients to raise their budget. But in G’est Media, we are helping our clients to get the best result from the lowest budget.<br>

								So here are some tips on what you should consider when allocating the budget.<br>

								1. Know exactly what you want<br>
								The thumb rule is to know what you want so that you won’t waste money on something unnecessary. It goes back to defining the core messages and shooting list of the video. With a good shooting list, we won’t be spending time on something that is not helpful to tell the story.<br>
								For example, if you are client from a bath tub company, and you are looking for a commercial introducing the product’s function. We will involve less shoots for the whole bathroom. However, if you want to promote the cut-edge design, we might spend more time demonstrating how it would look like in different styles of bathrooms.<br>

								2. Reduce the labor fee and rental fee<br>
								Shooting are the most expensive stage in the whole video production process. Reduce labor and time we spend on the project is most recommended if we have to work within a limited budget.<br>
								To have less labor, we can cut some locations or combine some locations. We can also tell story with more objects rather than human beings because it always take multiple times for photographers to get the best shoot when there are people moving around. Castings and some special equipment will raise rental fee. Based on different demands of the video, we will provide different solutions to our clients to make sure that we can accomplish shooting with less labor but still get good quality.<br>

								3. Remove the fancy staff from post-production.<br>
								Animation and visual effects do makes your video looks amazing. It is absolutely good to have them in the video. But sometimes it may not help communicating the message at all. When we have limited budget, it would be much better to spend money on other aspects rather than making fancy but useless visual effects. The problem is how we can decide if we need visual effects in our video.<br>

								Back to the bath tub example, if the client is promoting its function, we can use animation to explain how the mechanism works. If the client what the customers to visit their showroom, we can create a 3D map to point out the location.<br>

Here we have a detailed video production process, from which you can know how a video is produced from the very beginning and to learn how G’est Media can help you to achieve your business goals.
